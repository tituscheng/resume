\lettersection{About Me}

I failed in school most of my life, but everything changed when I went to University.  I asked myself this critical question "If a computer could upgrade its hardware, can the brain do the same?".  The exploration of this question became my obsession in searching for better ways to learn.  I then went from academic probation to being on the dean's list.    Ever since then I have a passion for education and in the fields of learning.  

%------------------------------------------------

\lettersection{Why Enlearn}

Enlearn is striving to change the educational space to become a company that I may wish I had when I was in school, I want to be a part of that to make that change.  Using machine learning and other technologies to make learning personal and more effective, it is a unique idea that could help millions of student achieving their best potential in the world.

%------------------------------------------------

\lettersection{Why Me?}

I believe my technical skills and experience in various startup will be an asset towards Enlearn and what the company is trying to achieve.  With my passion in the educational field, it helps drive that to achieve something great.
